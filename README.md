# AI Subscription Tier Simulator

**Link**: https://michaelcoffie.github.io/mike.ai/

## Overview

This interactive website demonstrates how AI accuracy, speed, and features vary dramatically based on subscription tiers, highlighting critical issues of financial accessibility in artificial intelligence technology.

## Purpose

This project was created to explore the ethical implications of tiered AI services, where the quality and accuracy of AI responses are directly tied to a user's ability to pay. Just as we see disparities in healthcare, legal services, education, and other sectors, AI is following the same capitalistic model where premium subscribers receive significantly better service.

## Key Features

- **Three Subscription Tiers**: Free ($0), Standard ($20/month), Premium ($200+/month)
- **Interactive Queries**: Test sample queries across different subscription levels
- **Real-World Examples**: Includes queries about product recalls, climate change, and medical advice
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of features and limitations
- **Societal Impact Discussion**: Explores the broader ethical implications

## Differences Between Tiers

### FREE TIER ($0/month)
- ⚠️ Slow response times (5-10 seconds)
- ⚠️ Low accuracy (60-70%)
- ⚠️ Vague, incomplete answers
- ⚠️ No source citations
- ⚠️ Data used for AI training (privacy concerns)
- ⚠️ Limited to 10 queries per day
- ⚠️ Community support only

### STANDARD TIER ($20/month)
- ✓ Moderate response times (2-4 seconds)
- ✓ Moderate accuracy (75-85%)
- ✓ Reasonably detailed answers
- ✓ Basic source citations
- ✓ Limited data collection
- ✓ 500 queries per day
- ✓ Email support

### PREMIUM TIER ($200/month)
- ✓✓ Fast response times (<1 second)
- ✓✓ High accuracy (90-98%)
- ✓✓ Comprehensive, detailed answers
- ✓✓ Full source verification and citations
- ✓✓ Complete privacy protection
- ✓✓ Unlimited queries
- ✓✓ 24/7 priority support

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No installation needed!

### Opening the Website

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

**Option 1: Double-click**
- Navigate to the project folder
- Double-click on `index.html`

**Option 2: Right-click**
- Right-click on `index.html`
- Choose "Open With" → Your preferred browser

**Option 3: Drag and drop**
- Drag `index.html` into an open browser window

### How to Use

1. **Scroll down** to view the subscription tier comparison
2. **Choose a query** from the dropdown menu (peanut butter recall, climate change, or medical advice)
3. **Click a tier button** (Free, Standard, or Premium) to see how the response differs
4. **Compare responses** by trying the same query across different tiers
5. **Read the impact analysis** at the bottom to understand the broader implications

## Sample Queries Included

1. **Product Recall**: "Is peanut butter recalled?"
   - Demonstrates how critical safety information varies by tier
   
2. **Climate Change**: "What is climate change?"
   - Shows the difference between vague and comprehensive scientific information
   
3. **Medical Advice**: "I have cold symptoms, what should I do?"
   - Highlights potentially dangerous implications of inaccurate health information

## Ethical Questions Raised

- Should access to accurate AI be considered a public utility or fundamental right?
- What are the consequences when low-income users receive less accurate information?
- How does this affect decision-making in critical areas like health and safety?
- Does this model perpetuate or reduce existing socioeconomic inequalities?
- Are companies deliberately limiting free-tier accuracy to increase revenue?

## Real-World Parallels

This simulation draws parallels to other sectors where financial accessibility determines quality:

- **Healthcare**: Free clinics vs. concierge medicine
- **Legal Services**: Public defenders vs. expensive law firms
- **Education**: Public schools vs. elite private institutions
- **Gaming**: Free-to-play demos vs. premium paid versions (Minecraft example)

## Project Context

Created for the **Social and Ethical Issues in Computing** course at the University of Miami (Fall 2025). This project examines how AI technology, despite its promise of democratizing information, may actually reinforce existing class divides through subscription-based access models.

## Discussion Points

The simulation is designed to spark conversation about:

1. **Corporate Motivation**: Are companies deliberately degrading free-tier performance to drive premium subscriptions?
2. **Cost Justification**: Does it genuinely cost more to provide accurate responses, or is this artificial scarcity?
3. **Social Impact**: How does information inequality affect society long-term?
4. **Alternative Models**: Could AI services be structured more equitably?
5. **Regulatory Considerations**: Should there be standards for minimum AI accuracy regardless of tier?

## Technical Notes

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no external libraries required
- The website simulates response times and accuracy levels using JavaScript timers
- The specific examples (like peanut butter recalls) are illustrative and may not reflect current events
- Response quality differences are modeled based on observed patterns in real AI services
- Fully responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to explore:
- More query categories (financial advice, legal questions, educational content)
- Statistical analysis of accuracy differences
- Cost-benefit calculator
- Historical data on AI pricing trends
- Comparison with other information services

## Author's Note

This project aims to make visible the often-invisible ways that financial resources affect access to technology and information. While AI has incredible potential to help humanity, we must critically examine whether its current business models are creating new forms of inequality or addressing existing ones.
